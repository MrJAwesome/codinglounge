                <h2>About The Server</h2>
                <p>
                    The Discord Coding Lounge was founded on Monday, May 2, 2022 at 3:56PM Eastern Time.  Its purpose was to have ticket channels for the MrJAwesome coding channel as it was getting hard to respond to all of the help comments.  Due to the fact that both the YouTube and the Discord grew exponentially, the staff members decided it was best to convert the server into a coding community.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    As we began to grow, the server became more and more active, as it allowed people developing discord bots to get help, and talk to each other and share ideas! The server grew into a community instead of just a help server.
                </p>

                <h2>Where we are today</h2>
                <p>
                    As of today, the Discord Coding Lounge offers coding help channels, discussion channels, community interactive channels, giveaways, and even premium access for those willing to <a style="color: rgb(163, 163, 255)" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3JG-y_RtMszRFkdxUrrEEQ/join">pay for it</a> on youtube.  Such features allow the developers of discord bots to come together and share their coding experience with help from the staff team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The server has grown to over 2k members, along with the growing YouTube community.  The community's interaction is staggeringly high, each announcement made gaining over 100 reactions within 24 hours.  Even further, more and more people are seeking help within our coding help channels, meaning the discord bot community is growing with us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of how far we have come, and the community we have built within the Discord Coding Lounge.
                </p>
