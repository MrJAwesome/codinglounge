                <h2>What are premium perks?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Discord Coding Lounge offers premium perks that allow users to get a variety of different things.  Depending on how much you spend, you can get a custom role, pastebins, or even a custom made discord bot!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Premium perks are purchased either with Discord Server Boosting, or purchasing a YouTube membership tier.
                </p>

                <h2>What are the perks?</h2>
                <p>
                    Basic Tier: If you purchase the basic tier on YouTube, you will have access to a baseline set of perks that are mostly related to YouTube.
                    <br></br>
                    Super Tier: The super tier comes with all the basic YouTube perks, but you will have access to PASTEBINS where you can copy and paste video code.
                    <br></br>
                    God Tier: The god tier comes with all the basic YouTube perks, pastebins, AND a custom role within the discord! This is the ideal tier to buy.
                    <br></br>
                    Custom Bot Tier: As the name suggests, by purchasing this tier you will get a custom made discord bot.  This tier also includes the previous perks.
                </p>

                <h2>How do I get the perks after buying?</h2>
                <p>
                    After purchasing one of these tiers, take the following steps to make sure you get all of your perks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get the baseline set of perks, you must connect your YouTube account that you bought the membership on to your Discord.  After doing so, you will automatically get the YouTube Member role which gives you access to the baseline perks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, if you purchased the super, god, or custom bot tier and you would like your pastebins, you can view the channel called pastebins within the premium perks section.  If you don't see the code you are looking for, you can request it be made in the pastebin-request channel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you purchased the custom bot tier, there are some extra steps you need to take for the team to make you a bot.

                <h2>Extra Information</h2>
                <p>
                    All of the membership tiers are handled through YouTube.  The tiers are a monthly subscription, that you can cancel any time. If you have questions regarding the purchase of a membership tier that cannot be asked by a staff member, we encourage you to reach out to YouTube support. Furthermore, due to the fact that your payments are handled through YouTube, we do not have access to any of your personal information; you don't need to worry about your payments getting leaked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are looking into purchasing a membership but you have questions, feel free to DM Modmail or Jackson.#0001 on Discord, and we will be happy to answer them.
