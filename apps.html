                        The coding helper role within the Discord Coding Lounge community is for members who have a very good understanding of their preferred coding language, and who want to willingly assist others in need of help.  This is the guide to applying for this role, as well as checking to see if you are a good fit to begin with.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Let's take a look at the basic needs of a coding helper:</h3>
                    <div class="dec">
                        • Have a deep understanding of at least one discord programming language
                        • Be active within the community - this includes helping people as much as possible
                        • Be mature and reasonable with the members
                        • Have an understanding that some people might not know much, and that you cannot be rude to them
                    </div>

                    <h3>What happens during and after the application process</h3>

                        When applying, it is important to fill out all the information correctly if you want to have a chance at getting the role.  This includes a proper email, name, discord tag, and selecting the programming language you are most familiar with.

                        After understanding these key points, you should be ready to apply for the coding helper role! Please keep in mind that this application process is only vetting; if we think you will be a good fit after this process, we will ask you more questions such as your timezone, the time of day you will be online, and we will even ask you to solve some code issues to test your knowledge!
